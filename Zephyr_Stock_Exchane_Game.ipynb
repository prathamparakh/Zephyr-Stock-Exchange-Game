        "# ## Game Overview\n",
        "# - Strategic stock market simulation for 2-6 players\n",
        "# - Players maximize net worth through buying/selling stocks and using event cards\n",
        "# - Turn-based gameplay with bargain sessions containing 3 trading rounds each\n",
        "# ## Core Game Components\n",
        "# ### 1. Player Setup\n",
        "# - Each player starts with ₹6,00,000 cash\n",
        "# - Track individual portfolios (cash + stock holdings)\n",
        "# - Player turn management system\n",
        "# ### 2. Stock System\n",
        "# - Initialize stocks with predefined opening prices:\n",
        "#   - HDFC: ₹25\n",
        "#   - Infosys: ₹80\n",
        "#   - TCS: ₹40\n",

        "#   - ONGC: ₹55\n",
        "#   - Wockhardt: ₹20\n",
        "# - Stock price updates only at end of bargain sessions\n",
        "# - Handle stock insolvency scenarios\n",
        "# ### 3. Event Cards System\n",
        "# - Deal 6-10 event cards per player at start of each bargain session\n",
        "# - Event cards affect stock prices (e.g., \"+₹15 to HDFC\", \"-₹30 to Infosys\")\n",
        "# - Cards are revealed simultaneously after 3 trading rounds\n",
        "# - Calculate net impact on each stock from all revealed cards\n",
        "# ### 4. Special Cards (one-time use)\n",
        "# - **Loan Stock Mature**: Instantly get ₹1,00,000\n",
        "# - **Right Issue**: Buy 50% more shares of target stock at ₹10 each\n",
        "# - **Debenture**: Sell insolvent company stock at original opening price\n",
        "# - **Stock Suspended**: Freeze stock price to previous session value\n",
        "# ### 5. Game Flow Management\n",
        "# - Bargain sessions with 3 trading rounds each\n",
        "# - Turn-based trading (buy/sell stocks, use special cards)\n",
        "# - Price updates after card reveals\n",
        "# - Win condition: highest net worth after preset sessions\n",
        "# ## Implementation Requirements\n",
